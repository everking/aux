*“In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.”  (Blaise Pascal)*

### St Josemaria Escriva, Patron Saint of Ordinary Work
“Your ordinary contact with God takes place where your fellow men, your yearnings, your work and your affections are. There you have your daily encounter with Christ. It is in the midst of the most material things of the earth that we must sanctify ourselves, serving God and all mankind.”

### St John Bosco, Patron Saint of Youth
“Everything and everyone is won by the sweetness of our words and works.”

### St Therese of Lisieux, Patron Saint of Little Things
“In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love."

### St John Paul II, Patron Saint of Families
“Life is entrusted to man as a treasure which must not be squandered, as a talent which must be used well.”
Let us help each other to grow in faith, hope and charity.  Let us lead many others to light so darkness will not prevail.

“In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.”  (Blaise Pascal)
