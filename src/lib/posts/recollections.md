The monthly evening of recollection is a time for personal prayer and reflection on topics to do with Christian life. The evening includes meditations preached by a priest, time for examination of conscience, opportunity for Confession or spiritual direction, and a talk given by a layman. An atmosphere of silence is maintained until after Benediction, when all may enjoy a snack and time for socializing.
