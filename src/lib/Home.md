Anyone with young children who tries to find useful information to help form or enculturate their children, that process could be frustrating.  Have you ever tried to:

* Locate a trustworthy website for education of the whole child?  
* Find a reliable classic education reading list?  
* Ship your child to a summer camp?
* Fellowship with other normal families?  
* Spend hours trying to find family friendly resources?  

If you have attempted any of the above, then you will find the goal of this website extremely useful.  The primary goal of the site is to provide a Single Point of Resource for "Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable." (Phil 4:8) We will attempt to connect specific resources that will help families grow in virtues and lead faith-filled lives.

The objective is to help families grow in self-mastery and self-giving.  We hope you will be able to contribute to the website and enrich its usefulness.  What are the lessons learned, best practices, stories to reach the heart, lessons of excellence, â€¦etc.
